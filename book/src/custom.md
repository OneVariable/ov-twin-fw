# Custom Applications

So far, we've mostly treated our firmware as an entity that ONLY behaves on requests from the
client. However, most real world firmware tends to be doing something normally, and the data
connection is only one part of influencing that behavior.

Consider building some type of application or game you could play WITHOUT sending commands from
your PC, like a guessing game, a visualizer of the potentiometer or accelerometer data, or something
else that allows the user to interact with the board, while still streaming information, or
accepting commands that change some configuration or behavior at runtime.

This part of the exercise is totally open ended, and please feel free to ask as many questions as
you'd like! I can't wait to see what you build!

Thank you for participating in this workshop.

I hope to hear from you all in the future!
