# Hello, ov-twin!

## Cloning the repo

Let's start by cloning the project folder:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/OneVariable/ov-twin-fw
$ cd ov-twin-fw
```

All of the software we'll need for both the **Host** (your PC), and the **Target** (the RP2040) is
in the `source/` folder.

Let's move to the "workbook/firmware" project. Note that this is NOT a workspace, so you may need to
launch your editor here. We'll explain the other parts of the project later.

```sh
$ cd source/workbook/firmware
$ ls -lah
total 128

```

## Build a project

We'll be building a project one at a time, from the `src/bin` folder. You can peek ahead if you'd
like, but there might be spoilers!

We'll start by building the first project, `hello-01`. This may take a bit if it's your first build,
or if the internet is a little slow:

```sh
$ cargo build --release --bin hello-01
   Compiling proc-macro2 v1.0.79
   Compiling unicode-ident v1.0.12
   Compiling syn v1.0.109
   Compiling version_check v0.9.4
   Compiling defmt v0.3.6
...
   Compiling fixed-macro-types v1.2.0
   Compiling fixed-macro v1.2.0
   Compiling pio-proc v0.2.2
    Finished release [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 16.44s
```

If you got an error, make sure you followed the [Setup steps](./setup.md), and let me know if you
are stuck!
