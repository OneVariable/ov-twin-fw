# Welcome

Welcome to the workshop! This is the first stage, where we'll get familiar with the goals we have
for today, and the board we'll be using.

You'll need two links today:

## The link for this book

We'll be working out of this for the whole workshop

<https://onevariable.com/rustnl-2024-workshop/>

## The link to the software repository

You'll also need this, as there's a lot of code here!
